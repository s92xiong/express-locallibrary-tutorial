# The LocalLibrary Website

A tutorial to learn Express by creating a website to manage the catalog for a local library.

LocalLibrary is the name of the website that we'll create and evolve over the course of this series of tutorials. As you'd expect, the purpose of the website is to provide an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.
