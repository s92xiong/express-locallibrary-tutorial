# The LocalLibrary Website

A tutorial to learn Express by creating a website to manage the catalog for a local library.

LocalLibrary is the name of the website that we'll create and evolve over the course of this series of tutorials. As you'd expect, the purpose of the website is to provide an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

There was a lot of Express contente learned from building a home page to display counts of instances of the models, and a list and detail pages for the books, book instances, authors & genres. This has helped me to gain the fundmanetal knowledge about controllers, managing flow vontrol when using async operations, creating views with Pug, querying the sites' databse using models, passing information to a view template, and creating and extending templates. There is a also a bit of experienced gained using Luxon to format dates.
