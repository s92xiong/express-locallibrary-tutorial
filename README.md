# The LocalLibrary Website

Node Version: v14.17.0

A tutorial to learn Express by creating a website to manage the catalog for a local library.

LocalLibrary is the name of the website that we'll create and evolve over the course of this series of tutorials. As you'd expect, the purpose of the website is to provide an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

In the 5th section of this express tutorial, there was a lot of content learned: I built home page to display counts of instances of the models, and a list and detail pages for the books, book instances, authors & genres. This has helped me to gain the fundmanetal knowledge about controllers, managing flow control when using async operations, creating views with Pug, querying the site's databse using models, passing information to a view template, and creating and extending templates. There is a also a bit of experienced gained using Luxon to format dates.
